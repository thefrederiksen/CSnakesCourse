## üöÄ Production Deployment Guidelines

### Python Installation for CSnakes-Based Projects

When deploying or building a project that uses CSnakes (such as FaceVault), it's important to ensure a consistent development and build environment. CSnakes relies on a locally installed Python runtime to analyze and generate bindings between Python and C# at build time.

#### üß± Recommended Deployment Practice

To avoid discrepancies across developer machines or build servers, we recommend the following:

**üîÅ Install the Same Python Version Everywhere**
- Choose a stable Python version, such as 3.10.x
- Install this version on:
  - All developer workstations
  - All build server environments

This avoids unexpected behavior due to differences in the way Python interprets annotations, dependencies, or library versions.

**üì¶ Tools You Can Use**
- pyenv (Linux/macOS)
- pyenv-win (Windows)
- Direct installer from python.org

**üìÅ Project Structure Notes**
- Make sure your .py files with CSnakes bindings are part of the project and available at build time
- Keep dependencies version-controlled (e.g., requirements.txt or a lockfile)

**‚úÖ Summary**
While CSnakes lets you embed Python for runtime, you still need Python installed to build unless you pre-generate bindings. Installing a consistent Python version across all environments keeps builds stable and avoids platform-specific issues.
