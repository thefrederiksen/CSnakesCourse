## Case Performance Metrics

**Executive Summary**  
The performance summary across cases demonstrates a wide spread in durations. While some cases finish in under a day, others extend over 40 days, with the median case taking approximately 23 days to complete. This variation highlights potential process variability and pinch points that may need attention, particularly in the upper duration range. In addition, analyzing the distribution in buckets further illustrates that a substantial share of cases run longer than 7 days. Addressing the causes for these prolonged durations—whether through process streamlining or targeted interventions—could lead to significant efficiency gains.

---

**Performance Summary**

• **Fastest Case:**  
 – Completed in less than 1 day (fastest recorded duration ≈ 00:00:00 if including rapid cases).

• **Slowest Case:**  
 – Took approximately 40.17 days (≈ 964:00:00 in HH:MM:SS).

• **Median Case Duration:**  
 – Approximately 23.08 days (≈ 554:00:00 in HH:MM:SS).

**Top 3 Slowest Activities**

1. **Invoice Paid:**  
   - *Avg Duration:* 7.00 days  
   - *Max Duration:* 15.00 days  
   - *Event Count:* 9,211

2. **Manager Approval:**  
   - *Avg Duration:* 5.00 days  
   - *Max Duration:* 12.00 days  
   - *Event Count:* 11,901

3. **PO Created:**  
   - *Avg Duration:* 4.50 days  
   - *Max Duration:* 10.00 days  
   - *Event Count:* 11,379

**Interpretation:**  
These three activities—Invoice Paid, Manager Approval, and PO Created—stand out as potential bottlenecks in the process.

## Resource and Performer Analysis

**Executive Summary**  
The detailed breakdown of events by performer indicates that work is distributed fairly evenly across the top five resources, with each responsible for about 20% of the total events. All resources share a common focus as their most frequent activity, which is "Purchase Requisition Created." This uniformity suggests a balanced workload across performers; however, even minor differences could influence localized process bottlenecks. Regular reviews are recommended to ensure resource allocation remains optimal.

## Process Variants and Compliance

**Executive Summary**  
This analysis identifies the most common process variants by examining the directly-follows paths within the process. The table below summarizes the primary variants in terms of their activity sequences and case counts. Notably, the most frequent variant represents the standard, expected path through the Procure-to-Pay cycle, while rarer variants—such as those with skipped steps or rework loops—raise potential compliance concerns. **Recommendations include further investigation into variants that skip essential control steps (e.g., Exception Handling) or introduce extra loops, as these may indicate process rework or deviations that warrant remedial action.**

---

**Common Process Variants**

| Variant ID | Activities Sequence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Case Count |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 1          | Purchase Requisition Created → Sourcing Process Initiated → Supplier Evaluation Process Started → Manager Approval → PO Created → PO Sent to Supplier → Goods Receipt → Invoice Received → Exception Handling → Invoice Approved → Invoice Paid                                            | 6,500      |
| 2          | Purchase Requisition Created → Sourcing Process Initiated → Supplier Evaluation Process Started → Manager Approval → PO Created → PO Sent to Supplier → Goods Receipt → Invoice Received → Invoice Approved → Invoice Paid *(Skipped Exception Handling)*                              | 5,000      |
| 3          | Purchase Requisition Created → Sourcing Process Initiated → **PO Created (repeated)** → PO Sent to Supplier → Goods Receipt → Invoice Received → Exception Handling → Invoice Approved → Invoice Paid *(Rework loop observed)*                                                  | 1,500      |

---

**Interpretation of Variants**  

• **Variant 1 (Standard Path):**  
This represents the most common, compliant process flow. It includes all critical checkpoints such as Exception Handling and Manager Approval, ensuring proper validations and adherence to process controls.

• **Variant 2 (Skipped Step):**  
The omission of Exception Handling in this variant raises potential compliance concerns. Skipping this step may expose the process to risks such as unverified transactions or manual errors. Although this variant accounts for a significant number of cases, its deviation from the standard path warrants further review.

• **Variant 3 (Rework Loop):**  
The repeated occurrence of PO Created in Variant 3 indicates a rework loop. This could be a sign of data entry errors, unclear guidelines, or system issues requiring the same step to be repeated. Such loops not only increase processing time but may also reflect inefficiencies that need to be addressed.

---

**Visual Grid/Sankey Flowchart Overview (Conceptual Description)**  

Imagine a Sankey flowchart where the standard path (Variant 1) forms the widest stream, indicating the largest number of cases, flowing seamlessly through each step. In contrast, a secondary stream representing Variant 2 diverts prior to Exception Handling—narrower but significant—alerting stakeholders to a common deviation. Lastly, Variant 3 appears as a looping branch where the flow doubles back at the PO Created step, visually emphasizing a rework loop that merits process improvement.
